// # Device limits
//
// The numbers live in a Limits value rather than in package constants, because
// z13ctl is being extended to other AMD devices whose chips have different power
// limits and per-profile PPT defaults. DefaultLimits returns the 2025 Flow Z13's
// values, which are correct for the only device supported today.
//
// The daemon does not yet serve its limits over the API — they live in z13ctl's
// internal/cli, which is not exported through the api module, so they have to be
// duplicated here for now. When that API lands the only change is where the
// Limits value comes from: fetch once at startup, Sanitized, falling back to
// DefaultLimits. Nothing else in the drawer moves. See the design brief in
// z13ctl's .claude/plans/device-limits-api.md.
//
// If the two ever disagree the daemon wins: it validates against hardware, and
// these rules only exist so the UI does not present an option that gets rejected.
