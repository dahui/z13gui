# z13gui

GTK4 overlay drawer for [z13ctl](https://github.com/dahui/z13ctl) on Wayland.

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

`z13gui` is the graphical companion to z13ctl — a slide-out drawer triggered by the
Armoury Crate button (KEY_PROG3). It renders as a Wayland layer-shell overlay (KDE Plasma,
Hyprland, Sway) or as a gamescope X11 overlay in Steam Gaming Mode. All hardware
communication goes through the z13ctl daemon.

## Install

Download the latest `linux_amd64` archive from the
[Releases](../../releases) page:

```sh
tar xzf z13gui_*_linux_amd64.tar.gz
sudo install -Dm755 z13gui /usr/local/bin/z13gui
```

See the [Installation guide](https://dahui.github.io/z13gui/installation/) for
AUR, Linuxbrew, source builds, and systemd service setup.

## Quick Start

Press the **Armoury Crate button** on your Z13 to open the drawer. Press it again,
click outside, or press Escape to close it.

The drawer controls profiles, battery charge limit, RGB lighting (mode, color, speed,
brightness), panel overdrive, and boot sound. All changes are sent to the z13ctl daemon
immediately and persist across reboots.
