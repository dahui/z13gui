# Trademark and Naming Policy
 
`z13ctl` and `z13gui` are released under the **Apache License 2.0**. That license
governs the **source code**. It does **not** grant rights to the project **names**.
This distinction is drawn by the license itself — Apache 2.0 §6 grants no trademark
rights — and this document explains how the names may and may not be used.
 
## Names this policy covers
 
The names **"z13ctl"** and **"z13gui"**, the command names they install (`z13ctl`,
`z13gui`), and the package names this project publishes (e.g. `z13ctl-bin`) are used
to identify the official software and its origin.
 
## What you may do — no permission required
 
- Use, fork, modify, and redistribute the **code** under the terms of Apache 2.0.
  The license means what it says; forking is welcome.
- Refer to the project **by name, truthfully** — e.g. "a fork of z13ctl",
  "compatible with z13ctl", "based on z13ctl". Nominative references to the origin
  are fine and expected.
## What we ask of forks and derivatives
 
Because the license lets you reuse the code freely, the responsibility for avoiding
user confusion falls on **naming**. If you distribute a modified version, please:
 
1. **Use a distinct name.** A name confusingly similar to "z13ctl" / "z13gui" —
   including a bare suffix like `-plus`, `-ng`, or `+` — reads as an official
   variant and is not, on its own, sufficient distinction.
2. **Ship your own command name** (e.g. `mytool`, not `z13ctl`) and your own
   systemd unit, socket, and state paths, so your build does not shadow or collide
   with an installed copy of the upstream software.
3. **Publish under your own package name.** If your package is intended to replace
   the upstream one, declare that relationship explicitly in your packaging
   (e.g. `conflicts` / `provides` on Arch) rather than silently occupying the same
   files.
4. **Do not imply endorsement** by, or affiliation with, this project or its
   maintainer.
## Why
 
These requests exist so that a user who installs, runs, or depends on "z13ctl" gets
the software they think they are getting, and so the origin of changes stays clear.
They are about preventing confusion — not about restricting your freedom to build on
the code, which Apache 2.0 fully grants.
 
## Questions
 
If you are unsure whether a particular use is fine, please ask first — open an issue
or contact the maintainer. We are glad to work it out.
